# Prebuilt apps for Android-x86 
App copyright is retained by the original authors. I've only included them here for convenience when building Android-x86. Before I release any builds, I will ask the authors whether it's okay to include their apps. If not, I'll remove them from the builds *before release* and from here.

READMEs will be updated when I've gotten replies from them.
